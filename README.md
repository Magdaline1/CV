## Skills

#### Analysis & research

Having completed a Law degree, I am confident in my ability to research and analyse documents when necessary. These are skills I used almost daily to gain further knowledge and deliver a well-rounded view on the topic at hand.

#### Communication

Whether written or verbal, I have been able to build on the way I communicate with people at different levels. This is mainly due to my extensive experience in customer service and administration roles, however my extra-curricular activities at university also played a big part in this.

#### Adaptability

In my previous roles, I have been able to pick up the use of new programmes and software to help complete a task. I have also learnt to use others for my own hobbies and independent projects such as video editing and graphic design. Some of the programmes include:
- Photoshop & InDesign
- Final Cut Pro
